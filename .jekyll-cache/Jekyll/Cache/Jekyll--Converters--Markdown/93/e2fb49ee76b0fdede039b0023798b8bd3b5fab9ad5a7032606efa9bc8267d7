I"<p>The Zhao Lab is located on the 5th floor of Research Building 6, in rooms 5.406 and 5.416. We are actively recruiting new postdocs and students. If you are passionate about any of our research topics and interested in joining our team, please email your CV to hazhao@utmb.edu.</p>

<h2 id="postdoctoral-fellows">Postdoctoral fellows</h2>

<p>We are seeking new postdocs in all areas of research, but we are particularly interested in researchers with a strong background in computation and statistics and interested in methods development.</p>

<h2 id="graduate-students">Graduate students</h2>

<p>Graduate students in the lab join from three different programs at UC Berkeley:</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>	<a href="https://ccb.berkeley.edu/academics/phd-in-computational-biology/">Computational Biology</a>.  This program is suitable if you have a mixed background in biology and computation and you think a program with rotations between different labs in the first year is preferable. </li>
<li>	<a href="https://statistics.berkeley.edu/academics/phd/admissions">Statistics</a>. This program is suitable if your undergraduate degree is in statistics or math with an emphasis on probability and statistics, and if you want to pursue rigorous training in statistics during your graduate studies.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="undergraduate-students">Undergraduate Students</h2>

<p>We welcome undergraduate students interested in pursuing mentored research.  The ideal student should be familiar with basic biology, be able to program well in at least one language such a Python, and have completed advanced coursework in statistics including Stat 134 and Stat 135 or equivalent.  It is usually difficult for us to find suitable projects for students interested in biology, but with no statistical or computational training.</p>
