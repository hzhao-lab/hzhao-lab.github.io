I"[<p>Dr. Zhao is an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Sealy Center for Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics at UTMB. His deep interests in studying biological complexity went back to his college time especially while reading Schrödinger’s book <em>What is Life?</em>. He started to use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nanoscale phenomena as such in ionic liquids and bionanotubes. For his PhD, he studied histone assembly with <a href="https://chem.umd.edu/people/garegin-papoian">Dr. Garegin Papoian</a> and <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/yamini-dalal">Dr. Yamini Dalal</a> through a joint <a href="https://ipst.umd.edu/research/nci">partnership program</a> between the University of Maryland and NIH/NCI. Through multi-scale computational simulations, his thesis work uncovered the folding principles and energetics of histones, including their centromeric variant and associated chaperones. During his postdoc with <a href="https://honig.c2b2.columbia.edu/">Dr. Barry Honig</a> at Columbia University Medical School, Dr. Zhao transitioned to systems biology, developing machine learning methods to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions. Currently, he is interested in applying ML/AI methods to study host-pathegen interactions.</p>

<p>I’m an Assistant Professor at [Rutgers University][2] in the [Department of Genetics][2].</p>

<p>Born and raised in India, as per cultural norm, I became an engineer/technologist. I received my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from [Anna University][3] (pronounced un-nah). [4]</p>

<p>I then received Ph.D. in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology][4] from [University of Tennessee, Knoxville][5], advised by [Mike Gilchrist][6]. During this time, I built models to understand the evolution of codon usage patterns.</p>

<p>I then did a postdoc with [Josh Plotkin][7] at [University of Pennsylvania][8], where I worked on whole-cell models of protein translation, the role of epistasis in protein evolution, built codon substitution models, and methods for identifying rate variation in phylogenetic trees.</p>
