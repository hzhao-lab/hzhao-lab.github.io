I"£<p>Dr. Zhao is an assistant professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and the Sealy Center for Structural Biology and Molecular Biophysics at UTMB. His deep interests in studying biological complexity went back to his college time especially while reading SchrÃ¶dingerâ€™s book <em>What is Life?</em>. He started to use molecular dynamics simulations to investigate nanoscale phenomena as such in ionic liquids and bionanotubes. For his PhD, he studied histone assembly with Dr. <a href="https://chem.umd.edu/people/garegin-papoian">Garegin Papoian</a> and Dr. <a href="https://irp.nih.gov/pi/yamini-dalal">Yamini Dalal</a> through a joint <a href="https://ipst.umd.edu/research/nci">partnership program</a> between the University of Maryland and NIH/NCI. Through multi-scale computational simulations, his thesis work uncovered the folding principles and energetics of histones, including their centromeric variant and associated chaperones. During his postdoc with Dr. <a href="https://honig.c2b2.columbia.edu/">Barry Honig</a> at Columbia University Medical School, Dr. Zhao transitioned to systems biology, developing machine learning methods to predict genome-wide protein-protein interactions. He is broadly interested in applying physical sciences and ML/AI methods to study biology questions. Current projects include host-pathegen interactomes and a collabration projects on allergen and tRNA synthetase.</p>
