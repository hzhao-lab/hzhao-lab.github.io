I"Ú<p>Hao is an undergraduate researcher who started to work with us in the summer of 2024. 
 an Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.genetics.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> in the <a href="http://www.genetics.rutgers.edu/">Department of Genetics</a>.</p>

<p>Born and raised in India, as per cultural norm, I became an engineer/technologist. I received my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from [Anna University][3] (pronounced un-nah). [4]</p>

<p>I then received Ph.D. in [Ecology and Evolutionary Biology][4] from [University of Tennessee, Knoxville][5], advised by [Mike Gilchrist][6]. During this time, I built models to understand the evolution of codon usage patterns.</p>

<p>I then did a postdoc with [Josh Plotkin][7] at [University of Pennsylvania][8], where I worked on whole-cell models of protein translation, the role of epistasis in protein evolution, built codon substitution models, and methods for identifying rate variation in phylogenetic trees.</p>
