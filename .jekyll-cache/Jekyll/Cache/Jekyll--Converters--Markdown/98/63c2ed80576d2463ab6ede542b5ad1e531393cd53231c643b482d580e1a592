I"ê<p>The framework of The Zhao Lab website was borrowed from the <a href="https://nielsen-lab.github.io/">Nielson lab</a> based on the original template provided by <a href="https://bedford.io/misc/about/">Bedford lab</a> for information about using Trevor‚Äôs template. Inspiration (and code) was also taken from other sites that use .</p>

<p>If you find any errors in this website (broken links, images not displaying, typos, etc.), feel free to report them to <a href="/team/andrew-vaughn">Andrew</a> so he can correct them. Feel free to also use the source code for the Nielsen Lab website, which can be found <a href="https://github.com/nielsen-lab/nielsen-lab.github.io">here</a>, for your own site (though we would of course appreciate a citation).

<p>This website is built based on the customized Jekyll system for research labs wrote by Trevor Bedford.</p>
