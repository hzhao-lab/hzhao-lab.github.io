I"Ž<p>Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor at <a href="http://www.genetics.rutgers.edu/">Rutgers University</a> in the <a href="http://www.genetics.rutgers.edu/">Department of Genetics</a>.</p>

<p>Born and raised in India, as per cultural norm, I became an engineer/technologist. I received my undergraduate degree in Biotechnology from <a href="https://www.annauniv.edu/BiotechCentre/">Anna University</a> (pronounced un-nah). <a href="http://eeb.bio.utk.edu/">4</a></p>

<p>I then received Ph.D. in <a href="http://eeb.bio.utk.edu/">Ecology and Evolutionary Biology</a> from <a href="http://www.utk.edu/">University of Tennessee, Knoxville</a>, advised by <a href="https://gilchristutk.wordpress.com/">Mike Gilchrist</a>. During this time, I built models to understand the evolution of codon usage patterns.</p>

<p>I then did a postdoc with <a href="http://mathbio.sas.upenn.edu/">Josh Plotkin</a> at <a href="http://www.upenn.edu/">University of Pennsylvania</a>, where I worked on whole-cell models of protein translation, the role of epistasis in protein evolution, built codon substitution models, and methods for identifying rate variation in phylogenetic trees.</p>
