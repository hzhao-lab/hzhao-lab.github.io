You hold a B.S. or M.S. in bioinformatics or computer science, with programming experience in C/C++, Python or Perl (experience with Perl or building web servers is an added bonus). Youâ€™re curious about gaining more exposure to ML/AI-led interdisciplinary research before deciding on a PhD or industry path. You write comments in your codes.
