Dr. Song is a postdoc fellow in the [Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at UTMB][1], working with [Dr. Haiqing Zhao][2]. During his PhD studies under [Dr. Feng Ding][3] at Clemson University, he focused on amyloid protein aggregation and interactions, gaining extensive experience in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, AI/machine learning, and biological data analysis to uncover the molecular mechanisms underlying protein-protein interactions (PPI). His current research involves development of computational models on predicting protein-protein binding affinity using computational biophysics and advanced AI models, *e.g.* transformer, graph neural network.
