# Abstract
We present an updated version of the Predicting Protein-Protein Interactions (PrePPI) webserver which predicts PPIs on a proteome-wide scale. PrePPI combines structural and non-structural evidence within a Bayesian framework to compute a likelihood ratio (LR) for essentially every possible pair of proteins in a proteome; the current database is for the human interactome. The structural modeling (SM) component is derived from template-based modeling and its application on a proteome-wide scale is enabled by a unique scoring function used to evaluate a putative complex. The updated version of PrePPI leverages AlphaFold structures that are parsed into individual domains. As has been demonstrated in earlier appli- cations, PrePPI performs extremely well as measured by receiver operating characteristic curves derived from testing on E. coli and human protein–protein interaction (PPI) databases. A PrePPI database of 1.3 million human PPIs can be queried with a webserver application that comprises multiple functionalities for examining query proteins, template complexes, 3D models for predicted complexes, and related features (https://honiglab.c2b2.columbia.edu/PrePPI). PrePPI is a state-of-the-art resource that offers an unprece- dented structure-informed view of the human interactome.
