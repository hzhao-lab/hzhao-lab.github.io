# hzhao-lab.github.io

This is the resource code of Zhao's research group [website](https://hzhao-lab.github.io) at University of Texas Medical Branch. This website is built based on the customized Jekyll system for research labs. The idea of such lab website set was originally inspired by [Shen lab](https://www.columbia.edu/~ys2411/). We referenced templates from [Bedford lab](https://bedford.io/misc/about/) (the original author) and [Nielson lab](https://nielsen-lab.github.io/). Valuable discussions with Dr. [Guang Shi](https://www.shisguang.com/) regarding Eleventy vs. Jekyll were also helpful in bringing this website to life.

A minimum manual for content updates: 
- Edit the `index.html` in root path to update the Homepage. 
- Similarly, edit the `index.html` inside each Tab folder: `Research/`, `Papers/`, `News/`, and `Team/` to update respective pages. 
- Inside each Tab folder, look for the `_posts/` and edit these markdown files for detailed post contents.
